    "# Explore IDR data using its User Interface\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook presents three workflows demonstrating how to find relevant data and metadata in the Image Data Resource. Each walkthrough is also available as a video which you can find both on the [Openmicroscopy YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/OpenMicroscopyEnvironment/videos) and [IDR homepage](http://idr.openmicroscopy.org/):\n",
    "\n",
    "* **From publication to IDR study**, viewing images and ROIs.\n",
    "  * Watch [From publication to IDR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFg2PAF3k7s).\n",
    "* **From gene to phenotypes**, orientating in metadata ecosystem. \n",
    "  * Watch [From gene to phenotypes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JboK6Kds28U&t=2s).\n",
    "* **From metadata to analytics**, using metadata to QA the results. \n",
    "  * Watch [From compound to analytical results](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stF4Q4m5GZg&t=1s)\n",

    "## Walkthroughs \n",
    "\n",
    "### From publication to IDR study, viewing images and ROIs\n",
    "* Start from PubMed search engine.\n",
    "  * Search for three terms: *Blin*, *Lowell* and *segmentation*. \n",
    "  * The first result will be a paper from *Blin et al* from Sally Lowell's Lab published in PLOS Biology in 2019.\n",
    "* Click on the icon in top-right for full text of the paper in PLOS Biology.\n",
    "* Inside the paper:\n",
    "  * Navigate to the *Data availability* section\n",
    "  * Go from there to the starting page at [IDR homepage](https://idr.openmicroscopy.org/)\n",
    "  * Search for a *Name (IDR number)* (the default option)\n",
    "  * Enter *62* into the second search box.\n",
    "  * Accept the suggestion and click on the thumbnail. \n",
    "  * This gives you all the images contained in the `idr0062` study.\n",
    " \n",
    "This workflow shows one of the main uses of IDR for data visibility, Quality Control for publishers and community. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the `idr0062` study, on the image http://idr.openmicroscopy.org/webclient/?show=image-6001239, we can see the attached `tiff` file with ROIs. These ROIs were extracted into OMERO ROIs (saved as masks), which can be seen overlaid onto the images.\n",
    "\n",
    "To see the ROIs:\n",
    "* Double-click onto the thumbnail of the image in the central pane. This will open the full viewer, called OMERO.iviewer.\n",
    "* Select the ROIs tab inside OMERO.iviewer. The mask ROIs will load.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return to OMERO.web in the next tab of your browser.\n",
    "* Click on the Experiment (named `idr0062-blin-nuclearsegmentation/experimentA`) and expand the `Attributes` harmonica in the right-hand pane. Find and click on the `Publication DOI` link. This will lead you to the publication we started with in *PLOS Biology*.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now continue this workflow using [Jupyter notebook](0_Python_API.ipynb) and OMERO API. The other GUI workflows below are for your information only.\n",
    "\n",
    "### From gene to phenotypes  (FYI only, not shown)\n",
    "* Start from the [IDR homepage](https://idr.openmicroscopy.org/).\n",
    "* Select Attribute `Gene`. \n",
    "* Search for *KRAS*. \n",
    "* In the results, find the study `idr0033A`. \n",
    "* This is a gene overexpression study by *Rohban et al.* from Carpenter Lab at BROAD institute. \n",
    "* Click on the `More...` link in the same line to the right of it. \n",
    "* You are navigated into the IDR. \n",
    "* Select the image http://idr.openmicroscopy.org/webclient/?show=image-3194247. \n",
    "* Study the right-hand pane and find the `Gene` block in Attributes harmonica. \n",
    "* Click on the icon in the `Gene Identifier` line. This will lead you to the NCBI website. \n",
    "* Go back to the IDR and scroll down in the `Attributes` harmonica. \n",
    "* Find the `low cell density` in one of the `Phenotype` metadata blocks.\n",
    "* Click on the `CMPO_000052` link underneath it. \n",
    "* This navigates to the search results page with all the images associated with this ontology term.\n",
    "* Select the top level node in the left-hand side and study the right-hand pane to see the standardization work done on the `CMPO_000052` (`decreased cell numbers`) phenotype. \n",
    "* Start typing in the box above the left-hand side pane to search for images associated with other phenotypes inside IDR. \n",
    "* Go back to the `KRAS` search results by clicking the back arrow in your browser.\n",
    "* Select one image in central pane. \n",
    "* Click onto the chain icon in the top of the right-hand pane and copy the link. \n",
    "* Paste the link into a new tab of your browser. \n",
    "* This navigates you to the full Plate view. \n",
    "* The image you were seeing inside the `KRAS` results is now highlighted in the context of the whole Plate.\n",
    "\n",
    "### From compound to analytics (FYI only, not shown)\n",
    "* Start from the [IDR homepage](https://idr.openmicroscopy.org/).\n",
    "* Select Attribute `Compound`. \n",
    "* Search for `Remdesivir`. \n",
    "* In the results, the study idr0094B is shown. \n",
    "* Click on `More...` This leads to inside the IDR. \n",
    "* Select the first image in the first container.\n",
    "* In the right-hand pane, scroll down to `Others` section of the `Attributes` harmonica.\n",
    "* Note the `DPC` number and compare with the density of the cells in the thumbnail. The `DPC` is showing the effectiveness of the Remdesivir compound against the cytotoxic effects of the `Sars-Cov-2` virus. The higher the DPC, the more intact the human cell monolayer in the images. \n",
    "* Compare this with the `Remdesivir` concentration, which is to be found in the same `Attributes` harmonice, above in the `Compound supplementary` section."
